<h1>The Best Movies According to Ashutosh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>It;s one of my favourites.The suspense that opens in the end blew my mind off on how on earth could anyone think like that</p>

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>It serves as the proper culmination of world building and character development. Some refuse to call it cinema but it is one of the greatest piece of art developed in recent years</p>

<h3>John Wick series</h3>
<p>Extremely intense film with unbelievable action set pieces choreographed in such a way that is enough to blow your brains off</p>
